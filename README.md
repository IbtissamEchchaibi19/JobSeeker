## üî¨ Project Overview 

**JobSeeker** This summer internship project was developed for *3D SMART FACTORY*, a Moroccan company specializing in 3D technology and AI. The project provides a comprehensive solution that simplifies the often complex and fragmented process of searching for jobs or internship opportunities. Typically, job seekers must rely on multiple platforms to manage tasks like resume building, generating interview questions, receiving personalized advice, and testing whether a specific job aligns with their skills and interests. Additionally, they must constantly search for real-time opportunities across different websites. This project consolidates all these functions into one platform, saving time and effort. By leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning them, combined with cutting-edge web technologies, it streamlines the job search process and enhances the user experience..
